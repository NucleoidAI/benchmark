This does not necessary mean Nucleoid runtime is faster than MySQL or Postgres, instead many DBs in production require constant maintenance by DBA team with adjusting indexing, caching, purging etc.  For average complexity applications, Nucleoid performance is close to linear because of on-chain data store as well as in-memory computing model. Again, thanks to declarative programming, Nucleoid low-code framework manages technical details while developers focus on business logic.
